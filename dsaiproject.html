                <h3 class="sub-heading">Project Overview</h3>
                <p>This mini-project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) explores and analyzes <span class="highlight">the Student Alcohol Consumption Dataset</span>. The project investigates potential correlations between student attributes, study habits, and academic performance, with a focus on predicting student outcomes and identifying differences between schools. Using data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, classification models, and hypothesis testing, this project provides valuable insights into factors that influence student success.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-heading">Problem Definition</h3>
                <p>The project addresses two main research questions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Can we predict whether a student will pass or fail both subjects based on their attributes?</li>
                    <li>Are there significant differences in students' conditions, study habits, and grades between students who attend Gabriel Pereira school and those who attend Mousinho da Silveira school?</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3 class="sub-heading">Data Preprocessing</h3>
                <p>We began with comprehensive data cleaning to prepare the dataset for analysis. This involved merging data from multiple sources, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming variables into appropriate formats. <span class="highlight">Feature engineering was performed to create a binary pass/fail target variable</span> based on student performance in mathematics and Portuguese language courses.</p>

                        <p>Used to predict student pass/fail status based on various attributes. The model revealed that <span class="highlight">second-term math grades (MG2) were the most important feature</span> in determining whether a student would pass or fail both subjects.</p>

                        <p>Conducted t-tests to compare study habits and academic performance between schools. This analysis revealed significant differences in Portuguese grades and study time between students from different schools.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-heading">Conclusion</h3>
                <p>This project demonstrated that while certain factors like study time and parental education have positive influences on student performance, others like travel time and previous failures have negative effects. <span class="highlight">The second-term math grade emerged as the strongest predictor of overall academic success</span>. Interestingly, we found that students from different schools showed similar performance in mathematics but differed significantly in Portuguese language grades. These findings provide valuable insights for educators and policymakers looking to improve student outcomes.</p>
